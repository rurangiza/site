### Typography

I use two main fonts:
- [Wotfard](https://www.atipofoundry.com/fonts/wotfard): for my headers and paragraphs
- [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code): for my code blocks

##### H1 (title)
# I've looked at clouds from both sides now

##### H2 (sub-title)
## I've looked at clouds from both sides now. From up and down and still somehow

##### H3 (section)
### I've looked at clouds from both sides now. From up and down and still somehow

# Mind Maps

## The art of organizing ideas

### Introduction

A **mind map** is a [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram) used to visually organize information into a [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy), showing relationships among pieces of the whole.[^1]

It is often based on a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas [branch out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure) from those major ideas.

Mind maps can also be drawn by hand, either as “notes” during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available.

Mind maps are considered to be a type of [spider diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map).[^2]

### Origin

Although the term “mind map” was first popularized by British popular psychology author and television personality Tony Buzan, the use of diagrams that visually “map” information using branching and radial maps traces back centuries.

These pictorial methods record knowledge and model systems, and have a long history in learning, brainstorming, memory, visual thinking, and problem solving by educators, engineers, psychologists, and others.

Some of the earliest examples of such graphical records were developed by Porphyry of Tyros, a noted thinker of the 3rd century, as he graphically visualized the concept categories of Aristotle. Philosopher Ramon Llull (1235–1315) also used such techniques.

### Buttons

Adding some text here because buttons will never be directly underneath a header.

<Button>Click here</Button>
