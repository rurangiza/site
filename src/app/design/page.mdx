## Understanding Message Queues
A message queue is a communication mechanism used in distributed systems to enable asynchronous message passing between different components, services, or applications. It acts as a temporary storage where messages are kept until they are processed by the receiving system.

### Key Concepts:

- **Producer**: The sender of messages.
- **Consumer**: The receiver of messages.
- **Queue/Topic**: Storage where messages are held until processed.
- **Routing**: The process of directing messages from producers to appropriate consumers.

### How they work
A message queue follows a producer-consumer model, where:

- **Producers** create and send messages to the queue.
- The queue holds messages in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) order (though some queues allow different processing strategies).
- **Consumers** retrieve and process messages from the queue.
- Once a message is processed, it is removed from the queue.

#### Illustration
<Canvas></Canvas>

Message queues ensure that messages are not lost if a consumer is temporarily unavailable. They also enable load balancing, as multiple consumers can process messages concurrently from the same queue.

#### In code

```python
def send_message(queue, message_body, message_attributes=None):
    """
    Send a message to an Amazon SQS queue.

    :param queue: The queue that receives the message.
    :param message_body: The body text of the message.
    :param message_attributes: Custom attributes of the message. These are key-value
                               pairs that can be whatever you want.
    :return: The response from SQS that contains the assigned message ID.
    """
    -> 
    if not message_attributes:
        message_attributes = {}

    try:
        response = queue.send_message(
            MessageBody=message_body,
            MessageAttributes=message_attributes
        )
    except ClientError as error:
        logger.exception("Send message failed: %s", message_body)
        raise error
    else:
        return response
```

### Examples of Message Brokers
- **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)** – A managed queue service on AWS.
- **RabbitMQ (using queue mode)** – An open-source message broker that supports queues.
- **Apache ActiveMQ** – A widely used open-source message queuing system.
- **Redis (when used as a queue)** – A fast, in-memory data store that can be used as a message queue.
