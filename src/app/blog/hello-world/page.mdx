# Hello World

Welcome to my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/), the place where I'll be writing to organize my thinking about topics I'm curious about.

Those include:
- Personal agents
- How the web works
- More broadly, [tools for thoughts](https://maggieappleton.com/tools-for-thought/)

In terms of writing style, I'm especially fan of [explorable explanations](https://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/), which are articles that you don't only read but also interact with.

<hr/>

In the `meantime`, here is piece of code worth dreaming about.

```javascript
import DeepThought from 'deepthought';
const dp = new DeepThought();

const completion = await dp.chat.completion.create({
  model: "deepthought",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "Be helpful and concise" },
    {
      role: "human",
      content: "What is the meaning of life?",
    },
  ]
});
```
